## Overview

The Side-by-side Modal offers a layout with two distinct sections. The left side is reserved for providing information or inputs, like text fields or dropdown. The right side is reserved for visual media that supports the content on the left, like an image that adds context. This layout works best when users need to reference visual elements alongside textual information.

## Use cases and examples

### Wizard footer

When multi steps modal, use the "wizard footer". For more guidelines about the footer we recommend to check our <StorybookLink page="Feedback/Modal [New]/Footer">ModalFooter</StorybookLink> page.

### Header with extra icon button

In case of a need of an icon button in the modal header, you can use our default header "Action slot".
You can also use it as a <StorybookLink page="Buttons/MenuButton">menu button</StorybookLink> component.

### Animation

Each modal includes an animation type based on its entrance point, with wizard modals also featuring transition animations. The default is the element trigger animation, which can be replaced with a center pop animation if there's no specific trigger. Transition animation is used exclusively for wizard modals and cannot be changed or removed.
