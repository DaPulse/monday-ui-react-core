# CommonJS imports (deprecated)

You might want to import directly the component from the dist folder

```javascript
import Button from "monday-ui-react-core/dist/Button";
```

In order to load all the relevant CSS tokens and CSS of all the components, you should import the `main.css` file at the root of your application file

```javascript
import "monday-ui-react-core/dist/main.css";
```
