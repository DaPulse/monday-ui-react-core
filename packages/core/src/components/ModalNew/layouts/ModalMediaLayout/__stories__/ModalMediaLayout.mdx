## Overview

The Media Modal includes a highlighted media section, followed by a textual content area. This modal is intended for cases when you need to catch the user’s attention using visual elements before they interact with the text. It’s ideal for introducing new features or short onboarding flows.

## Use cases and examples

### Wizard footer

When multi steps modal, use the "wizard footer". For more guidelines about the footer we recommend to check our <StorybookLink page="Feedback/Modal [New]/Footer">ModalFooter</StorybookLink> page.

### Header with extra icon button

In case of a need of an icon button in the modal header, you can use our default header "Action slot".

You can also use it as a <StorybookLink page="Buttons/MenuButton">menu button</StorybookLink> component.

### Animation

Each modal includes an animation type based on its entrance point, with wizard modals also featuring transition animations. The default is the element trigger animation, which can be replaced with a center pop animation if there's no specific trigger. Transition animation is used exclusively for wizard modals and cannot be changed or removed.
