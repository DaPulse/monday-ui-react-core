## Overview

A new typography change was introduced in `v2.24.0+`, including two new components: <Link href="/?path=/docs/text-text--overview" withoutSpacing> Text </Link> and <Link href="/?path=/docs/text-heading--overview" withoutSpacing>
Heading</Link>

## Why?

In order to produce a unified language, Vibe now uses a well defined set of typography variants and weights.
This change allows designers to create more accurate and refined designs, while enhancing the developer experience, making implementation easier and more intuitive.

## When to use

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    <>
      Use the{" "}
      <Link href="/?path=/docs/text-text--overview" withoutSpacing>
        Text
      </Link>{" "}
      component for paragraphs, labels, and texts up to 16px. It includes 2 variants: <code>Text1</code> and{" "}
      <code>Text2</code>. Each variant has a fixed size and three different weights.
    </>,
    <>
      Use the{" "}
      <Link href="/?path=/docs/text-heading--overview" withoutSpacing>
        Heading
      </Link>{" "}
      component the for titles and text from 18px and up. It includes 3 variants: <code>H1</code>, <code>H2</code> and{" "}
      <code>H3</code>. Each of these variant is mapped to a <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> element
      accordingly.
    </>
  ]}
/>

## How to import

```js
import { Text } from "monday-ui-react-core";
import { Heading } from "monday-ui-react-core/next";
```

<Tip emoji="⚠️" title="Notice">
  Heading is imported from `/next` since there's a legacy component with the same name. This component will replace the
  legacy component in the next major version.
</Tip>

## How to use

Each of these components can get the variants as a prop. You also get out-of-the-box built-in colors and an "ellipsis" with a Tooltip for a long text that breaks the line. For example:

```jsx
<Text type={Text.types.TEXT1} weight={Text.weights.NORMAL}>
  This is text1 normal
</Text>
```

```jsx
<Heading type={Heading.types.H2} weight={Heading.weights.NORMAL}>
  Normal H2 title
</Heading>
```

For a more detailed breakdown of the variants see the <Link href="/?path=/docs/foundations-typography--page#type-styles" withoutSpacing>Type Styles table</Link>

<Tip title="Notice">
  No need to define classes for text element and use typography CSS variables anymore, these components cover all the
  possible variants.
</Tip>

## How to migrate

For every new usage, use the new components. For existing usages, refactor gradually according to the migration table below:

<img src={migrationTable} alt="Migration table" />

### What if I need a variant that doesn't exist?

We highly suggest using the new components, but if it is still needed, SCSS mixins and CSS custom properties (CSS Variables) are still available. Read the <Link href="/?path=/docs/foundations-typography--page" withoutSpacing>Typography Foundation</Link> docs for more information.
