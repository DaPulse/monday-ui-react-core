## Installation

To install, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @vibe/icons
```

import { Close } from "@vibe/icons";
```

Alternatively, you can import the raw SVG files

### Peer dependencies

We are reliant on React and React DOM, we are using them as externals, and we don't package them to the package, so you must have them in your project
